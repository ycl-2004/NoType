Release: [build-2026-08-14](https://github.com/ycl-2004/NoType/releases/tag/build-2026-08-14)

### Added

- Bundled the WhisperKit/Core ML `large-v3` model and tokenizer in the friend-downloadable release archive.
- Added a repeatable release script that produces an app bundle, ZIP archive, and SHA-256 checksum.
- Added configurable dictation triggers: Double Command, Double Option, Command + Shift + H, and Disabled.
- Added configurable recognition-mode shortcuts and an independent Disabled option.
- Added modifier double-tap detection with cancellation when another input interrupts the sequence.
- Added a Diagnostics submenu for the latest debug event and log access.

### Changed

- The app now resolves bundled model resources before the developer-only local fallback path.
- The main menu no longer displays the last transcript preview or raw diagnostic path.
- Shortcut choices persist across launches and update registration immediately.
- The release version is now `0.2.0`.

### Verification

- 78 tests passed across 8 suites.
- Release ZIP and whole-bundle signature verified.
- Release ZIP SHA-256: `58aa8bd17e75f0e1636ea8e7cf8df9bca5937498af25b7fe1b22cce08e636569`.

### Known limitations

- The release is Apple Silicon-only and requires macOS 15.0 or newer.
- The current build is ad-hoc signed; Developer ID signing and notarization are still pending.
- There is no automatic in-app updater.
